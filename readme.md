## Roguelike

This is a currently unnamed Roguelike being built off of the [libtcod](http://roguecentral.org/doryen/libtcod/) library.

I am using [this](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod) awesome tutorial and taking a few liberties.  After I complete the tutorial we will see what direction the project goes in.
